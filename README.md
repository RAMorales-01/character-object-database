Small project to test class and object creation

This project is to test what the use of instance and classes,
the idea is: to create 6 character or "accout profiles" and later add this
to a database with Sqlite, then let the user see all the entries in the database, delete
and create new profiles with a max limit of 6 accounts simulating a party of characters.
