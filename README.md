Small project to learn and test SQLite 

This project is to test a database with SQLite, the idea is to let the user
create a character, choose name, race and vocation then add stats (DnD style)
then let the user retrieve the info of these characters and see the created character.
Basically is a small CRUD to test how to use a very basic database, mostly for self study.
